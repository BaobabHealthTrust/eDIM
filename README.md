# eDIM : Electronic Dispensing and Inventory Management

Supply chain management for pharmaceuticals is one area of concern for low-resource settings. Most health facilities in this setting struggle with quantifying consumption, availability, and demand of pharmaceuticals. This affects the availability of these resources which are critical for the delivery of effective health care. 
 
 Our goal is to help pharmacists effectively and efficiently manage their resources 
  while providing quality pharmaceutical services. We believe an information
  system at the dispensary level will mitigate workflow challenges, improve provider communication, and enhance the process of medication 
  management. Therefore, we created a system for electronic dispensation and Inventory Management (eDIM) as an open source software 
  platform that is designed to facilitate dispensary workflow and improve medication and inventory management.
